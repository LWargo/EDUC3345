                    " 'A man can never be too generous,' said our dad, 
                    'when he's generous to a good, hardworking honest hombre, 
                    because that man will then break his back to do all he can for you' "
                    <br>
                    I think this is a powerful quote about generosity and gives great insight into what Victor's dad's character.

                    " 'You better tell  your little brother,' George said to my brother Joseph, 
                    'that if he keeps talking like thism people are going to think that he's just a little girl.'
                    'Good!' I yelled. 'Let people think I'm a girl! Girls are ten times tougher and smarter than boys!'
                    'Who the hell ever told you that one?' said Chuck, laughing too.
                    [. . .] 
                    'Women are tougher and smarter than men, and they got to be! 
                    Because all life comes from between their legs!
                    That's why the most important thing any man can do in all his life is know how to choose the right woman for his wife!' "
                    <br>
                    I think this quote gives insight into Mexicano culture and how they valued women more than the Anglo culture at that time.

                    "I'd also found out that my mother was beautiful and my father was smart 
                    and that maybe I wasn't very good in the classroom, but still, I ... un Mexicano,
                    could think, organize a vote, and kick ass at recess!"
                    <br>
                    I liked this quote a lot because of the dichotomy between this quote 
                    and how he had felt earlier about his family. We can really see the process he is going through in order
                    to love himself and his culture and his famuly.

                    " 'we never take any life without showing respect. Above all, 
                    we never torture or have fun in the act of killing. Got it?
                    We know what we do, and we do it quick and gently and always for a good reason.' "
                    <br>
                    This quote is about Victor burning the frogs alive, and I think this quote does a 
                    great job of showing how his family interacted with the environment.
                    It also shows how his parents parented him,
                    which contributes to how he has grown up.
