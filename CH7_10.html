                    " 'A man can never be too generous,' said our dad, 
                    'when he's generous to a good, hardworking honest hombre, 
                    because that man will then break his back to do all he can for you' "
                    <br>
                    I think this is a powerful quote about generosity and gives great insight into what Victor's dad's character.

                    " 'You better tell  your little brother,' George said to my brother Joseph, 
                    'that if he keeps talking like thism people are going to think that he's just a little girl.'
                    'Good!' I yelled. 'Let people think I'm a girl! Girls are ten times tougher and smarter than boys!'
                    'Who the hell ever told you that one?' said Chuck, laughing too.
                    [. . .] 
                    'Women are tougher and smarter than men, and they got to be! 
                    Because all life comes from between their legs!
                    That's why the most important thing any man can do in all his life is know how to choose the right woman for his wife!' "
                    <br>
                    I think this quote gives insight into Mexicano culture and how they valued women more than the Anglo culture at that time.

                    Throughout the selection, Victor uses Spanish phrases and excalamations.
                    How does this affect the reader?

                    In Chapter One, we are given insights into the writing community.
                    Are there parallels between Victor's educational upbringing and the writing community he engages in?

                    Victor characterizes the A, B, and C/D students. 
                    How do these perceptions exist in schools today,
                    and how do they impact emergent bilinguals?

                    Victor tells Mr. Swift that he cannot be given an A and that he should receive a C+ at best.
                    How do we prevent this mentality from fostering in students?
