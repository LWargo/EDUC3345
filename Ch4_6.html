                    On his first day of school, Victor is terrified. 
                    He clings to his mom and feels as though he isn't ready. 
                    However, he sees a patch of eucalyptus trees, and one of them covered in twists and knots.
                    In those twists and knots, he sees a face and remembers how his mamagrande told him that trees are wise.
                    He hears the voice of the tree telling him to be strong and brave.
