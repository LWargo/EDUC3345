                    Captain Moses critiques the spelling of "Edmundo," 
                    claiming it to be spelled incorrectly, 
                    which proves to be a breaking point for Victor.
                    Explain the cultural significance of this moment.

                    Mr. Swift helps Victor to be passionate about writing by giving him a constraint-free space to write.
                    How could methods such as this be implemented in other subjects/fields of study?

                    Throughout the selection, Victor uses Spanish phrases and excalamations.
                    How does this affect the reader?

                    In Chapter One, we are given insights into the writing community.
                    Are there parallels between Victor's educational upbringing and the writing community he engages in?

                    Victor characterizes the A, B, and C/D students. 
                    How do these perceptions exist in schools today,
                    and how do they impact emergent bilinguals?

                    Victor tells Mr. Swift that he cannot be given an A and that he should receive a C+ at best.
                    How do we prevent this mentality from fostering in students?
