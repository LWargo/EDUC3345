# EDUC 3345 Principles and Practices for Teaching English Learners Portfolio
---
## Description 
This website is a portfolio for EDUC 3345. 
This class explores the process and culture around learning a second language, 
particularly for individuals who are learning English in an American pre-school to high school classroom.
Part of this class is studying the book *Burro Genius* by Victor Villasenor, 
so this portfolio is comprised of my personal experience with language learning 
and literature activities around *Burro Genius*.
