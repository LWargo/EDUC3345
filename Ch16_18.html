                    Upon losing his brother Joseph, Victor is comforted by the
                    idea of Shep, Joseph's dog, leading Joseph up to heaven.
                    <br>
                    How does this help him to cope with his grief, and 
                    how do we see this tie into other moments of spirituality
                    within Victor's life?

                    Victor tries to comfort his father in his grief over Joseph's passing by
                    explaining the story of Shep leading Joseph to heaven. Salvador reacts in anger, firing
                    Rosa and Emilio for talking about the "old ways of Mexico."
                    <br>
                    How did you interpret the choice to fire Rosa and Emilio? 
                    (e.g. rejection of "old ways," 
                    parallel to Victor's peer pressure to be more like his peers, 
                    reaction to grief, etc. )

                    Victor's teacher implies that he is the slowest learner in the class. 
                    <br>
                    What effects do implications like that have on the 
                    subject and their peers who hear comments like this?

                    Salvador, Victor's father, gets wasted at a bar and causes a ruckus.
                    Lupe, Victor's mother, is called to retrieve her rowdy husband,
                    and she bring Victor with her to help.
                    <br>
                    How can being placed into this situation at the age of 9 impact 
                    Victor's understanding of grief, relationships, and life?
