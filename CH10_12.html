                    In these chapters, Victor's family hosts a huge and glamorous housewarming party.
                    <br>
                    The floorplan, in the left image, is a representation of what I imagine the part of the house where the party takes place looks like.
                    In the front driveway, there is a truck to represent the worktruck from earlier chapters, and there is a fountain in front as well.
                    Entering the double doors, there is a bar to the front, kitchen to the right, and an office to the left, for the business Victor's father conducted.
                    The floorplan is adorned with lots of shrubbery, to represent the farm aspects intermingled with the mansion.
                    <br>
                    Below is a sketch of what I imagine the front of the mansion to be, with the fountain as a prominent feature.
