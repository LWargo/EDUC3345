                    For the end of Burro Genius, I was really touched by the scene with the dolphin where he imagines seeing Joseph
                    The sky is filled with the stars that he draws to comfort himself, to be a symbol of his grief because,
                    to me, this scene was him coming to peace, as much as he can be, with losing Joseph.
